# goalPerceptor
Goal post perceptor module. This module is developed as a patch for B-Human
framework and has been tested in the 2013 release. The code has been used by MRL
Nao team in RoboCup 2015 standard platform league (SPL).

To use this code you need to setup B-Human code release 2013. The later versions
might also be working. The framework is accessible on:
		http://b-human.de/

After installation of B-Human's code, put the provided files with the orginal
ones. This might be all you need to do, unless you have had modifications on the
representations.

Since, the B-Human method for setting white colors does not support every value
of white color, 'yellow' label is used to denote this color. In the other words,
you ought to label the goal posts as yellow. Please note that the color table
boundaries should be chosen wisely, specially at the lower part of the posts.

Feel free to use, modify or re-publish this code.
Please feel free to fork the code from Github and send pull requests.

# goalPerceptor
Goal post perceptor module. This module is developed in/for B-Human framework.

To use this code you need to setup B-Human code release 2013. It is accessible on
		b-human.de

After installation B-Human code release, all you need to do is to replace goal
perceptor modules with the one provided here.

Since, the B-Human method for setting white colors does not support every value
of white color, I switched back to yellow, and use 'yellow' label to set white
color. Please note that, choose the color table boundaries wisely!

Feel free to use, modify or publish this code.

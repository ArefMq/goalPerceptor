# goalPerceptor
Goal post perceptor module. This module is developed as a patch for B-Human
framework and has been tested in the 2013 release. The code has been used in
RoboCup 2015 standard platform league (SPL).

To use this code you may need to setup B-Human code release 2013. The later
versions might also be working. The framework is accessible on:
		http://b-human.de/

After installation of B-Human's code, replace the provided files with the orgin-
al ones. This might be all you need to do, unless you had modifications on the
representations.

Since, the B-Human method for setting white colors does not support every value
of white color, The 'yellow' button and label is used to denote this color. In
the other word, you ought to label the goal posts yellow.
Please note that, choose the color table boundaries wisely, specially at the
lower part of the posts.

Feel free to use, modify or publish this code.
Please feel free to fork the code on git and commit you changes.
